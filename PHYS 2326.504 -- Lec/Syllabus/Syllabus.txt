3. Course Pre-requisites, Co-requisites, and/or Other Restrictions
Prerequisites: PHYS 2325 (Mechanics) and MATH 2419 (Calculus II) or MATH 2414 (Integral
Calculus) or equivalent. Students must register for Physics Lab II (PHYS 2126). Familiarity with
basic mathematics (including algebra, geometry, trigonometry and basic integral and differential
calculus) is required and assumed.
4. Textbook and Materials
• Book: University Physics with Modern Physics (14thedition)
by Young and Freedman, publisher Pearson.
• MasteringPhysics: If you are purchasing the book, make
sure that it includes the student access kit in order to do the
online homework assignments. If you already have the book
and are not already registered, you will need to register at
http://www.masteringphysics.com so that you can access the
homework assignments for this class. When registering, you
will be asked for the MasteringPhysics course ID for this
class, which is S17PHYS2326RODRIGUES.
• You will also need a scientific calculator. Calculators with
graphing and/or memory capability will not be allowed during
any type of assessment, including exams. Bring your
calculator to lectures as well to double-check any calculations
we make.

5. Student Learning Objectives/Outcomes
The primary objectives of the course are (a) to gain an understanding of electromagnetism and
its relevance to the real world and (b) to develop the problem-solving skills needed for a
successful career in sciences and engineering.
As a result of the course, the student is expected to demonstrate an understanding of the key
concepts of electricity and magnetism - the laws, theories and relevant findings - and to be able
to apply this knowledge to solving problems.
Topics include:
• Electric Charge, Electric Force and Electric Field
• Coulomb’s Law and Gauss's Law
• Electric Potential Energy and Potential
• Capacitance and Dielectrics
• Electric Current and Resistance
• Direct Current (DC) Circuits
• Magnetic Field and Magnetic Force
• Lorentz force law for charged particles
• Electromagnetic Induction
• Faraday’s Law and Lenz’s Law
• Inductance
• Maxwell’s Equations
• Electromagnetic Waves
6. Assessments
Final grades are determined from a combination of the items below.
Exam 1* Exam 2* Exam 3* Final Homework Total
Weight 25% 25% 25% 25% 25% 100%
Date 2/9 3/9 4/13 TBD Weekly
* The lowest grade among exams 1, 2, and 3 will be dropped. Important: No make-up exams. If
you miss an exam, this will be your drop exam.
7. Course grading

9. Attendance, Homework, and Exams
• Attendance is not mandatory but students missing class without documented reason
automatically waive their right to any extra credit work that might be offered during
class.
• Please, be kind to your colleagues (and instructor) and avoid interruptions by turning off
your cell phones, laptops, and other electronics during lectures. Students failing to turn off
their electronics agree, if invited by the instructor, to participate in the lecture. Also, you are
asked to arrive and leave on time.
• Any announcement will be made, primarily, in class.
• Homework will be given through the website http://www.masteringphysics.com
- Go to the website, login as a student and follow the instructions.
- My course ID for this class is S17PHYS2326RODRIGUES.
- Make sure the name you give the website matches your name of record at UTD.
- No handwritten homework will be accepted.
- HW assignments are released on Fridays at 11:59pm and are due at 11:59pm on the
Saturday of the following week. Therefore, you have about 8 days to finish each HW.
- Late HW submissions will not be accepted.
- I strongly recommend you to print out your homework problems and do the work on your
printouts. It is a convenient way to keep everything together. Successful students have done
this in the past.
- You will be allowed to 20 (!) attempts per question.
- You are welcome to work together on homework but everyone must do their own
problems. You will notice everyone has different numbers.
• Exams will be in class and written.
- Valid picture ID (Comet card or driver’s license) must be on your desk during exams.
These will be checked.
- You must bring a scientific calculator to exams. Graphing calculators and
programmable calculators will not be allowed.
- You must show all work for exams. There will be no credit for just numbers (relevant
equations are required). You will not receive full credit for correct answers without work.
- All exams will be closed book. Formulas will be provided with the exam. You must know
the concepts and vocabulary for the exams. Exams will cover both in-class examples and
homework.
- Answers must be provided in ink. Bring pen and pencil to the exams.
- You will be responsible for all the reading assignments even if we do not discuss them in
class. This includes the power point slides available on eLearning.
- Any question about an exam grade must be addressed by the next class day after handing
out of the exam to the class. After that all grades are final.
- Make-up exam: There will be no make-up exams. Instead, you will be able to drop one of
the lowest exam grades. If you miss an exam, the grade for that missed exam will be
automatically dropped. Use your chance of dropping a grade wisely!

10. Resources for Student Success
In addition to lectures, the following efforts are made and resources are available to help
student success during this course:
• Instructor office hours: And feel free to ask questions after class.
• TA office hours: At least twice a week and not on the same days of instructor’s office
hours.
• Lecture slides: Copies of lecture slides will be made available on eLearning after each
lecture.
• Textbook: The lectures will follow closely the order, material, and notation used in the
textbook.
• Tutors: The Math Lab will make tutors available for this course. More information will be
given after classes start.
• Homework Assignments: Not only they will help you (a) better understand the material
seen in class and (b) prepare you for the exams, but they will also be graded so that you will
get credit for doing them.
